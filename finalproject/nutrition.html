            <span><b>1. Eat Breakfast.</b></span><br/><br/>
            You get energy from the first hour and you’ll be less hungry the rest of the day. It also sets the trend: you’ll tend to eat healthier if your day starts with a strong & healthy breakfast.

            Your best bet: omelets, smoothies & cottage cheese.<br/><br/>


        </p>
        
        <p id="step1">
            <b><span>2. Eat Every 3 Hours.</span></b> <br/><br/>
            The easiest way: breakfast, lunch, dinner, post workout, pre bed and 2 snacks in between. Benefits: <br/>

            <b>Less Hunger.</b> Eating more smaller meals vs. few big meals will decrease your stomach size. You’ll feel full faster and your waist will trim.
            <b>Less Cravings.</b> Not eating for long periods usually causes overeating at the next meal or ending at the candy machine.<br/><br/>
        </p>
            
         <p id="step1">
             <span><b>3. Eat Protein with Each Meal.</b></span> <br/><br/>
            You need protein to build and maintain muscle. Proteins also help fat loss since they have the highest thermic effect. And they satiate: proteins make you full longer than carbs.<br/><br/>

             How much protein should you eat daily? At least 1g per pound of body-weight. That’s 200g/day if you weigh 200lbs. The easiest way to get this amount is to eat a whole protein source with each meal. Some include:<br/><br/>

             <b>- Red Meat.</b> Beef, pork, lamb, deer, buffalo, etc.<br/>
             <b>- Poultry.</b> Chicken, turkey, duck, etc.<br/>
             <b>- Fish.</b> Tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, etc.<br/>
             <b>- Eggs.</b> Don’t believe the cholesterol myths. Eat the yolk.<br/>
             <b>- Dairy.</b> Milk, cheese, cottage cheese, quark, yogurt, etc.<br/>
             <b>- Whey.</b> Not necessary but great for easy post workout shakes.<br/><br/>


        </p>
            
            <p id="step1">
             <span><b>4. Eat Fruits & Veggies with Each Meal.</b></span> <br/><br/>
            Most of them are low calorie: you can eat your stomach full without gaining fat or weight. Fruits & veggies are also full of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber which helps digestion.<br/><br/>


        </p>
        
        <p id="step1">
             <span><b>6. Eat Healthy Fats. </b></span> <br/><br/>
            Healthy fats improve fat loss and health. They also satiate, digest slowly and are cheap. Eat healthy fats with every meal and avoid artificial trans -fats & margarine. Balance your fat intake.<br/><br/>
        </p>
            
        <p id="step1">
             <span><b>7. Drink Water</b></span> <br/><br/>
           Strength training causes water loss through sweating which can impair muscle recovery. Drinking water prevents dehydration but also hunger since an empty stomach can make you think you’re hungry.<br/>
            Drink 1 cup of water first thing on waking up, 2 cups with each meal and sip water during your workout.<br/><br/>
        </p>
            
        <p id="step1">
             <span><b>8. Eat Whole Foods 90% of The Time.</b></span> <br/><br/>
           <b>-Whole Foods.</b> Unprocessed and unrefined (or little refined) foods that come as close as possible to their natural state. Examples: fresh meat, fish, poultry, eggs, veggies, legumes, fruits, rice, oats, quinoa, … <br/><br/>
            <b>-Processed Foods.</b> Usually contain added sugars, trans-fats, nitrates, corn syrup, sodium and more chemicals. Examples: bagels, fruit bars, cereals, pizza, cookies, sausages, frozen meals, supplements, …
<br/><br/>
        </p>
            
        <p id="step1">
             <span><b>Examle Diet.</b></span> <br/><br/><br/>
            * Breakfast: eggs with veggies, orange, green tea<br/><br/>
            * Snack: mixed nuts, pear<br/><br/>
            * Lunch: tuna, roman lettuce, olives, olive oil<br/><br/>
            * Snack: cottage cheese with apple<br/><br/>
