        The snatch is the first of two lifts contested in the sport of weightlifting (also known as Olympic weightlifting) followed by the clean and jerk. The objective of the snatch is to lift the barbell from the ground to overhead in one continuous motion.

        Step 1 : The Setup
        </p>
        
            
            
            
        <p id="text3">
        Start with your feet hip-width apart directly under the bar. Bend over and grab the bar with a wide grip—30-plus inches, depending on your height and shoulder flexibility.get into a squat position with your back flat, arms straight, and hips higher than your knees. Look forward.
        </p>

            Step 2 : The Pull
        </p>
            
        <p id="text3">
            
        Lift with your legs, glutes, and back, keeping the bar very close to your shins but not contacting them or your knees as you lift the bar; It will brush your thighs on the way up. Once the bar is above your knees, accelerate with all your power as you extend your ankles, knees, and hips—aka triple extension—rising onto your toes.

            Step 3 : Receiving The Bar    
        </p>   
            
        <p id="text3">
            
        As you extend, shrug your shoulders and “pull” yourself under the bar, going into a full squat. As the bar passes your head, turn your wrists over and push the bar to a full lockout by driving with your shoulders and triceps. Your feet may jump out to shoulder width. You are now in a full squat position with your torso erect, your arms locked out at the elbows, and the bar directly over or a little behind your ears.

        Once you have secured control of the barbell, stand erect, extending your knees and hips. The bar must always stay directly over your ankles and hips.The snatch is not considered complete until the lifter is completely motionless. You should aim for the same goal. Lower or drop the barbell under control.
