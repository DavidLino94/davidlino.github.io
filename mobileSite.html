				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				I think this website met my expectations. 
                Their demographic are people of all ages which are interested in spending a good time with family and friends. 
                The site made really easy to look exactly what I was looking for: tickets for their theme park.  
                The content is pretty organized. It gives important information such as today's hours and the early entry.
                The "Buy tickets now" button is big enough to see and tap. Once you are in, you are able to find everything. 
                I think this website is a great example of a good web design application. Off course, it facilitates to people in the mobile environment. You find exactly what you need in the best format.
