            The purpose of this app is to help people to better be aware of the changes the weather could have. We know the weather influence our lives. This app will help us to plan what to wear and when to travel. Just one tap and life will be so much easier for you!

				<h1>Audience</h1> 
                
				<p>WeatherApp is literally for everyone that is interested to know the weather and its changes. Teenagers always want to know if it’s going to be cold or not. Adults, the same. Parents, they always want to know whether to send their children with a jacket or not.  And elderly people, they don’t want to be left behind and also want to know if it’s going to be hot or not. The one and only thing needed is a smarthphone.

				<h3>Made by: Ashley Nielson</h3>
                    <p>Ahley suggested putting the time bar in the bottom part. Which makes the app way more nicer and easier to understand. Good insight!
